# PATARA: Post-Silicon Validation Tool based on REVERSI

PATARA is an open-source tool for post-silicon validation of **any** fabricated processor. 
It is based on the REVERSI methodology in which the processor validates itself. 
The validation process is performed on random data and random instructions.
Therefore this tool can functionally verify functional units, and interactions between functional units and modules.

PATARA uses XML-configuration files to describe the characteristcs of a custom processor and it enables quick and easy adaptation to custom processors and ISAs. 
There is a description of the  processor as well as a configuration file to describe the instruction tests.

## Getting started

### Installation
Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/c3e-tubs/PATARA
```

Install python modules:
```bash
pip3 install xmltodict docutils
```

### Configuring-PATARA
The following configuration steps are available to configure PATARA to a custom processor.
The configuration files are stored in `sources`.

1. Instructions can be added in `instructions.xml`.

2. The processor specifications can be modified in `processor.xml`.

3. In `header.txt` and `footer.txt` the startup and shutdown instruction can be modified. 




### Running-PATARA
To access the help message, run 

```bash
python3 main.py -h 
```

A single instruction test can be started with
```bash
python3 main.py -v -1
```

Creating all configurations of all instructions can be generated with
```bash
python3 main.py -v -2
```

Interleaving testcases can be generated with
```bash
python3 main.py -v 1
```
